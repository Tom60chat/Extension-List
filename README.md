# Extension List
This is my attempt to list all existing popular file extension.  
  
Can be used for testing purposes, such as file explorer previews.  

## Extension finder Website
[Website](https://tom60chat.github.io/Extension-List/)  
Quick search engine, to know if a extension exist and what he look like.  
And show can a list of every extensions. (Wiki like?)

<i>That's the idea, but I won't develop it because I don't want to spend the little time I have for it.
Feel free to develop it.</i>

You can help by adding/correcting files.
  
  
### What file extension can I add?
Please don't put unpopular file extensions like: 
  - MyFirstApp.TomAwesomeAppThatNoOneUse  
  - config.TAconf (Tom App configuration file)  
  
Exemple of popular files:  
[ISO standars](https://en.unionpedia.org/List_of_International_Organization_for_Standardization_standards)  
[List of file formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_formats)
  
By unpopular, I mean, file extensions that have not been included in professional software or used very little.  
  
  
### How do I name the file?
Just put the full name of the extension.
You can find them on Wikipedia, like:  
MP4 -> [Wikipedia:MPEG-4_Part_14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14) -> MPEG-4 Part 14.mp4  
  
  
### What content I can to put inside?
When generating a file, use default examples like:  
  - For texts: take the Lorem Lipsum from "Text Document.txt".  
  - For images: take the "Portable Network Graphics.png" file and convert it.  
  - For videos: take the file "MPEG-4 Part 14.mp4" and convert it.  
  - For the sounds: take the file "MPEG-1_2 Audio Layer III.mp3" and convert it.  
  - For the others :  
    - Lorem Lipsum for media and visual. (Take the Lorem Lipsum from "Text Document.txt")  
    - "hello, world" for code.  
    - 
If possible, keep the file size small (50KB~ - 1MB~), files over 100MB are not accepted.  
  
  
### What if there is more than one extension for a type?
Create a folder with the same name as the file and put all files of the same type with a different extension name in it.
